# Brainfuck-Go

## About
This is an interpreter written in Go-Lang for the esoteric Brainfuck Programming Language. Brainfuck is notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

## What this project is about
This project aims to create a working interpreter of Brainfuck from the scratch. This utilizes Go-Lang to write the interpreter for the programming language.

## What more can be done 
- The project only encapsulates the working of Brainfuck, but one could certainly take it further to other esoteric programming languages and write their interpreter.
- Also, another thing that can be done is to write a compiler for Brainfuck.
