# What we'll Build - 
By following this repo, you can understand the basics and development of a simple interpreter to an esoteric programming language like Brainfuck. Also, you will polish your Go-Lang skills. Although, this project utilizes Go-Lang, feel free to make use of any other programmign language that you feel comfortable with like Python, Java, C++ etc. The general idea behind the project remains the same.

# Who this Project is for - 
This repo encapsulates a toy interpreter. So in my opinion, this project serves any programming enthusiast who finds stuff like this interesting. Anyhow, this project serves beginners who are just starting out with small projects and want to build something and polish their skills.
 
# What we'll Learn -
- Simple file parsing using go-lang
- Understand the basics of Interpreters
- How to structure a small project 
- Structures, Types, Interfaces and Stacks

# Where to Start - 
- Start by understanding how the brainfuck programming language works, this [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) can be really helpful in doing the same.
- After learning about how it functions, write down specifications on what components you need to implement in order for this to work. Components like ByteCells, Data Pointer, Instructional Pointer, Main Program Loop.
- Next, you gotta think about what programming constructs to use like - functions, structs, types, interfaces, arrays etc.
- Then, start implementing them piece by piece and refer to this repo wherever an error occurs or you reach a deadend. 
- The general structure mostly remains the same however different your implementation is or however different the programming language you used is.


# What we can Extend to - 
- You can build a Brainfuck compiler
- You can implement similiar interpreters of othere Esoteric Programming Languages
